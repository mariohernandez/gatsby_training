# Plugin createPages

So, the last possible way pages are created?  A plugin does all the work we just showed, for you and behind the scenes!

We should get to plugins overall later, but just know that all of the code we did could be published to \`npm\` as a Gatsby ‘source’ plugin `gatsby-source-my-plugin` and someone else could `npm install` it and it would create pages for them as well, as long as their data types match.

Now we know that Gatsby has a special way of making pages for us.  Let’s look at one cool out of the box feature we can use with these pages.  It’s called Gatsby Link.
