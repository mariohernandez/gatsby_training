A hands-on training workshop by [Mediacurrent](https://mediacurrent).

This is a hands-on training workshop which will walk you through the process of building a fully decoupled Drupal website with GatsbyJS as its front-end.

### Training objective

Main objectives of the training are to identify all the pieces involved in building a fully decoupled Drupal site where the Front-end is simply consuming the content provided by Drupal and can be built completely independently of Drupal.  For the purpose of this training we have chosento use GatsbyJS as the Front-end framework, but this could also be done with other frameworks such as NextJS, AngularJS, etc.
